# Bubbles App Documentation

The Bubbles App is an interactive game where you shoot arrows at bubbles on a canvas. Here's a brief overview:

- HTML: Defines the structure of the app with a heading, canvas, and reset button.
- CSS: Styles the app's elements, including the canvas, heading, and reset button.
- JavaScript: Manages the game logic, drawing bubbles and arrows, handling clicks, and resetting the game.

To use the app:
1. Include the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in your web page.
2. Open the page in a browser that supports HTML5 canvas.
3. Click on bubbles to shoot arrows.
4. When a bubble is hit, it changes color, and if all bubbles are hit, the game resets.
5. Use the reset button to manually reset the game.

Customization:
- Adjust bubble positions and colors in the JavaScript code.
- Modify CSS styles to change the app's appearance.
- Update canvas size in the HTML code.

Event Handlers:
- `handleClick`: Initiates arrow movement when a bubble is clicked.
- `reset`: Resets the game when the reset button is clicked.

Utility Function:
- `allCirclesHit`: Checks if all bubbles are hit.

That's a summary of the Bubbles App documentation. Enjoy shooting bubbles!
